The pay station program had my teammate and I create methods and write test code that had to follow specific requirements that were provided by the professor. We had to create a mapping in the source code that tracked all of the different types of  and amount of coins that have entered the pay stations. We had to tweak the methods that we created to make them work for other requirements such as when calling cancel the program returns a map doesn’t return a coin that hasn’t been entered. We completed all of the requirements for the project. We didn’t make any personal improvements to the projects.

Trevor- I contributed 7 commits to the project. The first commit I pushed to git hub was counting the total amount of money entered. At this point in the project I really didn’t understand the full requirements and messed this method up and had to revise it later on. The second and third commit I had was creating test cases for when I call cancel it doesn’t add the amount returned by empty. My Last commits were where I created test cases for the cancel methods. During these commits I had to edit some of the source code to make sure it satisfied the requirements.
